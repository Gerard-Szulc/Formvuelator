# Formvuelator

Form generator created in vite and vue 3.

After long way of using many form generation tools for vue, I decided to make one by myself.
I plan to provide this features in this library:
- nested collections
- many field events (blur, change, etc)
- provided data model autocompletion/automatic creation (dont know how to call it)

This is my first vue library project, so I look for suggestions and help.
Currently lib is working only in vite vue 3 app (not tested other variants).

More details about schema structure and other things later...
